Advantages:
A BFS will find the shortest path between the starting point and any other reachable node. A depth-first search will not necessarily find the shortest path.

Disadvantages
A BFS on a binary tree generally requires more memory than a DFS.


Graph:
1. Queue for BFS
2. Stack for DFS

LINKEDLIST:
1. Insert at beginning: O(1) //bcz head pointer available
2. Insert in between: O(n)   //bcz traversing required
3. Insert at end: O(n)      // no tail pointer in singly LinkedList
4. Insert after a node: O(1) //no traversing required
5. Remove a node b/w 2 nodes: O(1) 
// delete ith node(n2).. loop to get i-1(n1)... 
n0->n1->n2->n3 (remove n2) => p=n1->next; n1->next=n2->next; delete p;  ==> n1->n3
